#NFL IA Play-by-Play

This is a Node.js and Brain.js project that was developed as a final project for the Cloud & Cognitive Internship immersion program. The program focused on studying IBM Cloud & Cognitive, Open Source, and Agile technologies and methodologies, and later joined the IBM Data & AI team to build proof-of-concept assets for pre-sales using AngularJS (JavaScript) and Express (Node.js) integrating the Watson AI services.

The NFL IA Play-by-Play project utilizes Brain.js, a JavaScript library for creating neural networks, to predict the outcome of a play in a National Football League (NFL) game based on the play's attributes. This project is intended to demonstrate the potential of AI and machine learning in the sports industry.
