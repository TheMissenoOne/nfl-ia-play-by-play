#NFL IA Play-by-Play

This is a Node.js and Brain.js project that was developed as a final project for the Cloud & Cognitive Internship immersion program. The program focused on studying IBM Cloud & Cognitive, Open Source, and Agile technologies and methodologies, and later joined the IBM Data & AI team to build proof-of-concept assets for pre-sales using AngularJS (JavaScript) and Express (Node.js) integrating the Watson AI services.

The NFL IA Play-by-Play project utilizes Brain.js, a JavaScript library for creating neural networks, to predict the outcome of a play in a National Football League (NFL) game based on the play's attributes. This project is intended to demonstrate the potential of AI and machine learning in the sports industry.

How to Use
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/TheMissenoOne/nfl-ia-play-by-play.git
cd nfl-ia-play-by-play
npm install
You can then run the program using the following command:

Copy code
node app.js
This will start the server and make the application available at http://localhost:3000. From there, you can input the attributes of a play and the neural network will predict the outcome.
